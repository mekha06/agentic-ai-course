# Tool Selection and Routing

## Introduction

An agent may have access to multiple tools.

Example:

```python
calculator_tool()
weather_tool()
search_tool()
```

The challenge is deciding which tool to use.

This process is called Tool Selection.

---

## Example

User:

```text
What is 25 × 50?
```

Agent:

```text
Use calculator_tool
```

---

User:

```text
Weather in Kochi?
```

Agent:

```text
Use weather_tool
```

---

## Tool Routing

Tool routing refers to directing a query to the correct tool.

Workflow:

```text
User Query
↓
Intent Detection
↓
Tool Selection
↓
Tool Execution
```

---

## Metadata

Tools are usually described with metadata.

Example:

```python
{
  "name": "calculator",
  "description": "Perform mathematical calculations."
}
```

The LLM reads the description and chooses the correct tool.

---

## Key Takeaways

- Agents often have multiple tools.
- Tool selection determines which tool to use.
- Routing directs tasks to the correct tool.

# Function Calling

## Introduction

Function Calling is the mechanism that allows an LLM to request execution of a tool.

Instead of directly answering, the model generates a structured tool request.

---

## Example

User:

```text
Calculate 25 × 16
```

Model Output:

```json
{
  "tool": "calculator",
  "arguments": {
    "expression": "25 * 16"
  }
}
```

The application executes the tool.

---

## Workflow

```text
User Query
↓
LLM
↓
Function Call
↓
Tool Execution
↓
Result
↓
LLM
↓
Final Answer
```

---

## Benefits

- Reliable tool usage
- Structured communication
- Easy integration with external systems

---

## Key Takeaways

- Function calling connects LLMs to tools.
- Tools are executed outside the model.
- Results are returned to the model.

# Structured Outputs

## Introduction

Agents need predictable outputs.

Instead of free-form text:

```text
I think this is probably a weather query.
```

We prefer:

```json
{
  "intent": "weather",
  "city": "Kochi"
}
```

---

## Benefits

- Easier parsing
- More reliable automation
- Better integration with applications

---

## Common Formats

### JSON

```json
{
  "intent": "search"
}
```

### Dictionary

```python
{
  "tool": "calculator"
}
```

### Pydantic Models

Used in production systems.

---

## Example

User:

```text
Weather in Delhi
```

Output:

```json
{
  "intent": "weather",
  "tool": "weather_tool",
  "arguments": {
    "city": "Delhi"
  }
}
```

---

## Key Takeaways

- Structured outputs make agents reliable.
- JSON is the most common format.
- Function calling depends on structured outputs.
